There is eight planets in our solar
system. Today I'm going to be teaching you

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.260
the names of those eight planets as well
as a mnemonic to help you memorize the

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.240
order of those planets starting from the
sun. Let's take a closer look.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.800
The first planet, and closest to the sun,
is Mercury.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.760
Then Venus. Then Earth.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.680
Mars. Jupiter. Jupiter.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.659
Saturn. Uranus.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.060
Neptune. Alright, now that we got the
planets

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.000
down, let's match them up to the mnemonic.
My.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.360
Very. Expensive.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.780
Made. Just.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.940
Served. Us.
